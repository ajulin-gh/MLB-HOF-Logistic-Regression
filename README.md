# MLB-HOF-Logistic-Regression

This is a personal project of mine using multiple linear and logistic regression in RStudio to determine if a baseball player would be elected into the Hall of Fame based on a number of career statistics. Using data collected from Baseball Reference I have gone through multiple trials to determine the most accurate model. Tne files I have uploaded contain the R Markdown notes I have written about as I worked. This is an ongoing project that I will continue to update as I find models with higher adjusted R-Squared values.
